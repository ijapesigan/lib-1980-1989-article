  abstract = {Presents data on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 14-item measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Concurrent and predictive validities and internal and test-retest reliabilities of the new scale were determined using scores from 446 undergraduates and from 64 Ss (mean age 38.4 yrs) participating in a smoking-cessation program offered by the university. Results show that the PSS had adequate reliability and was a better predictor of the outcome in question (depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance) than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independent predictive construct. Additional data indicated adequate reliability and validity of a 4-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. It is suggested that the PSS, which is appended, be used to examine the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},
