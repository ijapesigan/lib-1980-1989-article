  abstract = {It is often assumed that covariance structure models can be arbitrarily applied to sample correlation matrices as readily as to sample covariance matrices. Although this is true in many cases and leads to an analysis that is mostly correct, it is not permissible for all structures. This article reviews three interrelated problems associated with the analysis of structural models using a matrix of sample correlations. Depending upon the model, applying a covariance structure to a matrix of correlations may (a) modify the model being studied, (b) produce incorrect values of the omnibus test statistic, or (c) yield incorrect standard errors. An important class of models are those that are scale invariant (Browne, 1982), for then Errors a and b cannot occur when a correlation matrix is analyzed. A number of examples based on restricted factor analysis are presented to illustrate the concepts described in the article.},
