  abstract     = {A number of models for the analysis of moment structures, such as linear structural relations, have recently been shown to be capable of being given a particularly simple and economical representation, in terms of the reticular action model (RAM). A formal algebraic treatment is presented that shows that RAM directly incorporates many common structural models, including models describing the structure of means. It is also shown that RAM treats coefficient matrices with patterned inverses simply and generally.},
