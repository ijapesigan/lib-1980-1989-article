  abstract = {Comments that cross-lagged correlation (CLC) is not a useful procedure for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. In particular, the difference between CLCs is not a sound basis for causal inference. Demonstrations of the failure of CLC are based mainly on results for the 2-wave, 2-variable longitudinal panel design. Extensions of these results to panels with multiple waves and multiple measures reveal additional problems; each 2-wave snapshot did not yield dependable results. Taken together, the 2-wave analyses were often contradictory and misleading.},
