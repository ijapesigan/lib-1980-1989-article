We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.},

One is based on sums of powers of coefficient matrices. The other defines total effects as reducedform coefficients. I show the conditions under which these two definitions are equivalent. I also compare the different types of specific indirect effects. These are the influences that are transmitted through particular variables in a model. Finally, I propose a more general definition of specific effects that includes the effects transmitted by any path or combination of paths. I also include a section on computing standard errors for all types of effects.},

Alcohol-seeking behavior is a special case of exploratory appetitive behavior and involves different neurogenetic processes than do susceptibility to behavioral tolerance and dependence on the antianxiety or sedative effects of alcohol. Three dimensions of personality have been described that may reflect individual differences in brain systems modulating the activation, maintenance, and inhibition of behavioral responses to the effects of alcohol and other environmental stimuli. These personality traits distinguish alcoholics with different patterns of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological responses to alcohol.},

A person decides consciously or unconsciously to consume or not to consume any particular drink of alcohol according to whether or not he or she expects that the positive affective consequences of drinking will outweigh those of not drinking. Various factors (e.g., past experiences with drinking, current life situation) help to form expectations of affective change from drinking, these factors always modulated by a person's neurochemical reactivity to alcohol. Such major influences include the person's current nonchemical incentives and the prospect of acquiring new positive incentives and removing current negative incentives. Our motivational counseling technique uses nonchemical goals and incentives to help the alcoholic develop a satisfying life without the necessity of alcohol. The technique first assesses the alcoholic's motivational structure and then seeks to modify it through a multicomponent counseling procedure. The counseling technique is one example of the heuristic value of the motivational model.},

Depending upon the model, applying a covariance structure to a matrix of correlations may (a) modify the model being studied, (b) produce incorrect values of the omnibus test statistic, or (c) yield incorrect standard errors. An important class of models are those that are scale invariant (Browne, 1982), for then Errors a and b cannot occur when a correlation matrix is analyzed.

The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems.

These omissions can produce severe biases in estimates of the size of causal effects. Longitudinal models also can fail to take account of time lags properly, and this too can lead to severely biased estimates. The discussion illustrates the biases that can occur in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, introduces the latent longitudinal approach to causal modeling, and shows how latent longitudinal models can be used to reduce bias by taking account of time lags even when data are available for only 1 point in time.},
